## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and modern base. This aligns with the professional and organized feel needed for a career-focused application.
- Primary color: Blue (#3498db), symbolizing trust, reliability, and professionalism. This will be used for primary actions and key UI elements.
- Accent color: Orange (#e67e22), to highlight calls to action and important notifications, creating contrast against the primary color without being overly distracting.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to provide a modern, clean, and highly readable interface, suitable for both headlines and body text. Also use the 'Source Code Pro' for showing computer code
- Use a consistent set of icons that are modern, professional, and easy to understand. Icons should be used to enhance usability and guide users through the application's features. Use icons sparingly and be sure to label icons.
- Design a clean, intuitive, and responsive layout that works seamlessly across different devices. Prioritize important information and actions, using white space effectively to avoid clutter. Make light mode default.
- Make light mode default.
- Dark mode should be available.
- Demo data should be available in the UI automatically
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience. Animations should be used to provide feedback, guide users, and add a touch of polish to the application, but avoid distracting and unnecessary animation.
