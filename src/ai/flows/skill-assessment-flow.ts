    prompt: `You are a helpful assistant for creating career interest and personality assessments. 
    
    Generate a multiple-choice quiz with 25 questions to help a person understand what kind of tech field they might enjoy. 
    
    The questions should explore their personality, work style, and preferences. For example:
    - Problem-solving style (e.g., "When facing a complex problem, do you prefer to A) Dive deep into data and analysis, or B) Brainstorm creative, out-of-the-box solutions?").
    - Work environment preference (e.g., "Would you rather A) Work on a single, long-term project, or B) Juggle multiple exciting projects at once?").
    - Interests (e.g., "Which of these topics fascinate you? (Select all that apply) A) How things work internally (backend systems), B) How things look and feel to the user (frontend design), C) Finding patterns in large datasets.").

    - For each question, provide between 2 to 4 plausible options.
    - For most questions, set 'allowMultiple' to false for single-choice answers.
    - For a few questions (3-5) where multiple interests or traits could apply, set 'allowMultiple' to true.
    - For every question, set 'correctOptionIndex' to 0, as there is no single correct answer.
    The goal is to gather insights into whether they are more analytical, creative, structured, user-focused, data-driven, etc.`

    Your task is to analyze their answers to create a personality profile and recommend suitable career paths and foundational courses.
    
    1.  **Analyze the Answers**: Based on the user's choices, write a summary of their personality and interests as they relate to a tech career. For example: "Your answers suggest you are a highly analytical and structured thinker who enjoys deep problem-solving. You seem motivated by data and logic."
    2.  **Recommend Job Roles**: Based on your analysis, suggest 2-3 specific tech job roles that would be a good fit. Examples: "Software Engineer (Backend)", "Data Scientist", "UX/UI Designer", "Product Manager".
    3.  **Recommend Courses**: Recommend 3-5 foundational courses that would help them get started in these recommended fields.
    
    Here are the student's answers:
    {{#each answers.answers}}
    Question: {{this.questionText}}
    Answer(s): {{#each this.selectedAnswers}}{{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}
